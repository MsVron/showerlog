# Authentication & Redirect Fix

## Issue
After successful sign-in, users were staying on the `/signin` page instead of being redirected to the dashboard.

## Root Cause
The redirect was happening too quickly before the authentication cookie was properly set, causing timing issues.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Sign-in Redirect Logic
- Added multiple fallback mechanisms for redirect
- Implemented 100ms delay for cookie setting
- Added 1-second fallback redirect using `window.location.href`
- Added loading states for better UX

### 2. Dashboard Authentication Protection
- Added `useEffect` hook to verify authentication on dashboard load
- Redirects unauthenticated users back to sign-in

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Added redirecting state and visual feedback
- Clear form data after successful sign-in
- Proper loading states during authentication process

## Files Modified
- `app/signin/page.tsx` - Enhanced redirect logic and UX
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added authentication verification

## How It Works

1. User submits sign-in form
2. API sets authentication cookie
3. Multiple redirect mechanisms ensure successful navigation:
   - Primary: `router.push("/dashboard")` after 100ms
   - Fallback: `window.location.href` after 1 second if still on signin page
4. Dashboard verifies authentication on load
5. Middleware protects routes and handles redirects

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/signin`
2. Enter valid credentials
3. Should see "Redirecting..." message
4. Should automatically redirect to `/dashboard`
5. If somehow stuck, fallback redirect activates after 1 second

## Styling Consistency
All pages maintain the shower/water theme with:
- Pixel fonts for headers
- Glass effect containers
- Water drop animations
- Blue color scheme
- Consistent bubble shadows
