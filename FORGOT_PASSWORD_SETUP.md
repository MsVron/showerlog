## Overview
The forgot password functionality has been successfully implemented with a complete flow from requesting a password reset to setting a new password.

## Features Added

### 1. Forgot Password Link on Sign In Page
- Added "Forgot your password?" link below the sign in form
- Consistent styling with the app's blue theme
- Properly positioned and accessible

### 2. Forgot Password Page (`/forgot-password`)
- Clean, consistent design matching other auth pages
- Email validation and error handling
- Success state with clear instructions
- API integration with `/api/auth/forgot-password`
- Responsive design with glass effect styling

### 3. Reset Password Page (`/reset-password`)
- Accessible via email link with token parameter
- Password strength validation (minimum 6 characters)
- Password confirmation matching validation
- Uses the new `PasswordInput` component with eye icon
- Success state with redirect to sign in

### 4. API Integration
The pages integrate with existing API endpoints:
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Sends reset email
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Validates token and updates password

## User Flow

1. **User forgets password**
   - Goes to sign in page
   - Clicks "Forgot your password?" link

2. **Request reset email**
   - Enters email address on forgot password page
   - Receives success message (even if email doesn't exist for security)
   - Email is sent with reset link (if account exists)

3. **Reset password**
   - Clicks link in email (includes token parameter)
   - Lands on reset password page
   - Enters new password twice with validation
   - Password is updated and user is redirected to sign in

## Security Features
- Email verification required for password reset
- Token-based reset with expiration (1 hour)
- Password strength requirements
- Secure message handling (doesn't reveal if email exists)
- Tokens are single-use and cleared after successful reset
