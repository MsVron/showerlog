don't comment the code and don't use emojis make everything seem like it's purely human-written

document what you do in an .md file in a way that makes the project open source and ppl can follow the guide to use it locally

the idea is:
- the quickest sign up and log in in the universe
- enter a thought or smth you wanna do -> takes a task and autoâ€‘breaks it into subtasks
- click to get new thoughts 
- check thoughts you like click save to save it to the database
we want to use a pre-trained model for this. please tell me what the best open source tool for this, we will use google colab so make sure you write a jupytr notebook 
technologies: this app must be deployed through v0 and neon/postgre 
use Next.js and typescript,
everything must be quick and free 
im aiming to be done with this in under 4 hours. 
do you think it's possible?
give the prompt to give v0 for it to generate the frontend for this for us, tell it all the pages you will need 
make the ui clean, and i hope to use the theme of shower in the background and smth inspired by old old pixeled japanese games, the ui should be soft
and reserve a button of github on top right to link our open source project 





let's start by you giving me the prompt of V0, let's leave the rest for later
